                you don't know what course to pick look at the course catalogue to help make a decision.<br> When you
                know what course to pick email your adviser of studies to find out if it is a suitable choice.</div>

            <div class=\"\">If you are adding a course it is usually much simpler so long as it doesn't conflict with
                another course.<br> If it doesn't conflict then you can most likely do it on MyCampus. If it does
                conflict then read \"Who will change your courses\"</div>

        <div id=\"c3\" class=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\">
            <div class=\"\">The add/drop period exists to give students time to try out courses and still be able to
                change without falling too far behind, therefore changing courses outside the add/drop period could
                result in a lot of extra work for you - especially if you have missed assessment for the course you wish
                to change to.<br>Changing courses is still possible however you should certainly discuss it with your
                adviser to ensure that you make the best decision for you.</div>

        <div id=\"c4\" class=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\">
            <div class=\"\">Though you can change courses yourself in almost all situations you should goto the SSO
                first.<br> The SSO can then tell you if they can solve the problem or if you need to go to the college
                office.<br>However going to the SSO is only necessary when you are going to drop a course (this includes
                dropping a course to pick another course up and any time where you will drop a course), this is because
                they can add a course before dropping one which means you will never get stuck without a course.</div>

        <div id=\"c5\" class=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\">
            <div class=\"\">Any time you are considering changing courses it is always recommended you discuss this with
                your adviser as they really are best placed to answer questions and help you decide what is right for
                you.</div>
