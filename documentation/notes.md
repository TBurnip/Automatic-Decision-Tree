 ### Test 1

 ```json
{
    "why": "As you may have guessed changing degree programme is a major thing. Due to the nature of changing degrees you need to discuss it with your adviser so that you know all that is involved and how to go about it. It will also be useful to discuss why you want to change in case something in the department can be improved to yours and others benefit. And finally it will be important to ensure that you don't have to repeat a year due to a lack of credits in the degree you want to change to.",
    "what":"I'm thinking of changing degree from [current degree programme] to [possible future degree programme]. What is involved in this and How should I go about it?"
}
